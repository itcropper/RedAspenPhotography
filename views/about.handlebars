            I grew up in Southern Oregon with the lush, green, dewy forest as my backyard. I could be found outside with my little film camera, that was gifted to me from my parents at my 7th birthday, most of the time. Or finding other creative outlets. My Grammie told a few years back, “I always knew you would settle with a creative career.” Somehow I missed that mark and pushed myself in a corporate world for many years.

         <p>With new beginnings in Colorado a few years ago, it was time to do what came natural and felt effortless. My high school sweetheart husband gifted me a camera and told me to run as fast as I could toward what we both knew made me the happiest in life.</p>

         <p>So here I am! I love being a storyteller and meeting such amazing people in this community. I hope that my images will be looked back on by children, grandchildren and even great-great grandchildren. Which is why I try to capture who you are in a timeless manner with emotion, detail, and care.

         <p>If I am not behind my camera, then you may find me crossing off “must-do’s” from my ongoing bucket list, traveling in the Rocky Mountains (I am always looking for the next secret photography location), testing a new restaurant in the area, camping in Moab (it’s a favorite), eating a whole bowl of popcorn to myself, or wandering the foothills with my rescue puppy and husband.
